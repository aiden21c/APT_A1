# Tremauxs-Algorithm

In this assignment you will implement a version of Trémaux’s algorithm for solving simple mazes.

This is a full C++ program that:

1. Reads in a 20x20 maze from standard-input (std::cin).
2. Solves the maze (using the Simplified Trémaux Algorithm in Section 2.1).
3. Prints out the solution to the maze to standard output (std::cout).
4. Prints out walking/navigation directions (that you could follow to walk through the maze).
